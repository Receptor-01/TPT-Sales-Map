Start by first downloading your teachers pay teachers product sales report at the following destination: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/My-Sales

Apply the date range you want to map out. I think it's capped at 1 year maximum.

Then download the full report:

After downloading, manually rename your TPT sales report CSV to 'sales-report.csv' to ensure naming consistency.
